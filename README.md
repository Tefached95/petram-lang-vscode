# petram-lang-vscode

Petram: Chiseled for Clarity.
A language with verbosity as a feature, focused on data orientation, DevEx ergonomics, expressiveness, and rigid structure.

This is the repository for the VS Code extension that provides syntax highlighting and, in the future, language support such as intellisense, go to symbol or declaration, type checking, etc.
